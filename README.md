# Project Title

Movie Data Base analysis: Analyzing the features of the data set 

Problem Statement : To determine the contribution of each feature like starcast , director , etc for a particular movie to be hit






## Authors

## Data

The data 

movies(1).csv ( This data was fetched from IMBD site)

## Install

This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed

`Pandas`

`Numpy`

`Matplotlib`

`Seaborn`

`Sklearn`






Code

Exploratory Data analysis code is provided in the EDA_storytelling.ipynb file. 
You will also be required to use movies(1).csv dataset file to begin your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to make project better.
## Project Roadmap


`Outlier detection and removal on each features.The Outlier module is created to detect outliers and remove them. The module is imported into the data.py file for implementation`

`data.py is used to clean the raw extracted data and transform into a presentable format for further analysis. The file generates clean data called cleaned_movie_data.csv which is to be used for further analysis` 

 
`In the EDA_storytelling,ipynb we have done the complete analysis`

`Correlation check`


`We derived which feature has the highest dependency on movie earnings , and which one is lowest`
